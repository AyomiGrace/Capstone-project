            <p>It always feels very refreshing. It also makes me feel connected to God.</p>

        <p>I love traveling to new places, to see the world from a different angle.

        <li><h2>Living Healthy</h2></li>
        <p> This has become one of my top priorities. I have kinda scheduled a healthy living
            daily routine for myself, from my waking up in the morning to my bed time at night.
            This includes my early morning devotion, which help me set the right spirit in motion for
            a happy and fulfilled day. Going to Gym or early morning indoor exercises, 
            this has always helped me to keep fit. Also eating healthy, self improvement on my Career
             and so on.
